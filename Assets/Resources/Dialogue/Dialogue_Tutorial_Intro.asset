  text: 'So Sir Thanatos, as you clearly don''t plan on carrying a sword with you,
    we will need another way for you to deal with enemies on your quest!

    You shield looks sturdy enough to do a good bit of damage if you give something
    a good smack with it!

    Press <sprite="xbox_one_buttons" index=1> to dash.'
