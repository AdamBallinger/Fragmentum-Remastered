  text: "Before you go, your shield is useful for more than just smacking things with!
    \n@\nBelieve it or not you can use it to protect yourself from most projectiles
    your enemies will launch at you!\n@\nJust remember you can't jump with your shield
    up, and you will walk slightly slower too!\n@\nHold <sprite=\"xbox_one_buttons\"
    index=3> to block.\n@\nOne more thing! If you come across anything that doesn't
    seem to be affected by your shield smacks, try giving them a boot to the head.
    That usually does the trick!\n@\nGood luck Sir Thanatos! Gloom Forest is just
    ahead."
